# Purpose

Find a way to understand the intermediate results of VGG model

## Workflow

get imageset with two classes only (e.g. dogs / cats)
run vgg to intermediate phase, output one vector per image
calculate and review similarity metric, observe where similarity for in-class is better compared to between-class
